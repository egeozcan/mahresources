# First Steps

This guide walks you through the basic workflow of organizing content in Mahresources.

## Understanding the Data Model

Before diving in, it helps to understand how Mahresources organizes information:

- **Resources** - Files you upload (images, documents, videos, etc.)
- **Notes** - Text content you create
- **Groups** - Collections that can contain Resources, Notes, and other Groups
- **Tags** - Labels you can attach to Resources, Notes, and Groups
- **Categories** - Organize your Tags into logical groupings

## Step 1: Create a Category

Categories help organize your tags. Let's create one for project status.

1. Navigate to **Categories** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Category**
3. Enter a name like "Project Status"
4. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Create Some Tags

Now create tags within your category.

1. Navigate to **Tags** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Tag**
3. Enter "In Progress" as the name
4. Select "Project Status" as the category
5. Click **Save**

Repeat to create "Completed" and "On Hold" tags in the same category.

## Step 3: Create a Group

Groups are the primary way to organize related content.

1. Navigate to **Groups** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Group**
3. Enter a name like "Research Project"
4. Add an optional description
5. Click **Save**

You can create nested groups by setting a parent group, building a hierarchy for complex projects.

## Step 4: Upload Resources

Add some files to your group.

1. Navigate to **Resources** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Resource**
3. Upload a file by dragging and dropping or clicking to browse
4. Add a name and description
5. Under **Groups**, select "Research Project"
6. Under **Tags**, select "In Progress"
7. Click **Save**

Repeat to add more files. Each resource can belong to multiple groups and have multiple tags.

## Step 5: Create a Note

Add a note to document your findings.

1. Navigate to **Notes** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Note**
3. Enter a title like "Initial Observations"
4. Write your note content
5. Select a Note Type (create one first if needed)
6. Under **Groups**, select "Research Project"
7. Optionally link to specific Resources
8. Click **Save**

## Step 6: Use Global Search

The fastest way to find anything is global search.

1. Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux)
2. Start typing your search query
3. Results appear instantly, showing Resources, Notes, and Groups
4. Click a result to navigate directly to it

Global search uses full-text search across all your content, making it easy to find items even when you don't remember exactly where they are.

## Step 7: Explore Relationships

View how your content is connected.

1. Open the "Research Project" group
2. See all Resources and Notes in this group
3. Click on a Resource to see its details, including all Groups and Tags
4. Use the related items to navigate between connected content

## Tips for Effective Organization

- **Use Groups for projects or themes** - Keep related items together
- **Use Tags for cross-cutting concerns** - Status, priority, type of content
- **Use Categories to organize Tags** - Prevent tag sprawl
- **Link Notes to Resources** - Connect your thoughts to source materials
- **Use the global search liberally** - It's faster than navigating
